# Airport Simulation

This program implements a queue data structure to provide the user with arbitrary analytics on a fictitious airport simulation.

Testing Documentation:

    - After creating multiple Airport Objects, and running with different probabilities,
        it shows that the probabilities are accurately calculated.
    - Testing was done to make sure that there are no memory leaks and it is proven that
        all allocated memory has been freed after the program quits.

    - In Third simulation, no planes crashed :)
